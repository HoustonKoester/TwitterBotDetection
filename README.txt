DATASET INFO

The dataset used for this project is too large to submit in canvas, but it is accessible from
    https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets/caverlee-2011/caverlee-2011.zip
and was taken from the following paper:
Lee, Kyumin, Brian David Eoff, and James Caverlee.
"Seven Months with the Devils: A Long-Term Study of Content Polluters on Twitter." ICWSM. 2011.

The sampled and amended verison of the above dataset we used for analysis is included in
./analysis/completedData.xlsx. This was generated by selecting a random subset of the
dataset, removing malformed entries, computing additional features using feature_extraction.py,
and exporting as an .xlsx for convenience.

CODE INFO:

./analysis/feature_extraction.py includes functions to compute the additional features
that we used to train our model. These functions were imported into an interactive shell
in iPython to create completedData.xlsx.

./analysis/models.py includes the actual code to train and test the models.

./analysis/completedData.xlsx includes the data we used in models.py, this was generated
by selecting a random subset of the dataset, computing additional features
using feature_extraction.py, and exporting as an .xlsx for convenience.
